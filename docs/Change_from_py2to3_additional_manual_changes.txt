Changes made from Python2 to Python3 version of PyFluxPro

all        | 1) Copy directory PyFluxPro into new directory PyFluxPro3
           | 2) Run 2to3 on PyFluxPro3 inside the directory which should be converted
           | 
           | 2to3 --help  # shows help message
           | 2to3 .       # dry run, shows what will be changed between python2 and python3
done       | 2to3 -w -n . # writes the new (python3) files and does not create backups of the old (python2) files

3) Manual changes necessary since 2to3 does not find e.g. integer division accidental or deliberate 
   using / instead of // for integer division
   Dictionaries are quite different between python2 and 3
   

Result:

a) integer division (used wing and search all files for /
    pfp_clim.py       69, 238
    pfp_compliance    99
    pfp_cpd           546, 566, 567, 590, 591, 593
    pfp_gf            149, 742
    pfp_gfALT         350
    pfp_io            608
    pfp_plot          183, 351
    pfp_rp            1389
    pfp_ts            638, 2678
    pfp_utils         2146

b) python2 default strings are bytes but in python3 these are unicode
   changes to opencsv file for write 'wb' to 'w' or specify what b means
    pfp_gfSOLO         771, 780, 841, 850, 893, 902
    pfp_io             396, 595, 694, 936
   changes to opencsv file for read 'rb' to 'r'
    pfp_io             159, 310

c) timedelta element int64 is not a default but float(i) works
    pfp_rpLT           117

d) scipy curve_fit xdata: in py2 a dictionary for xdata was fine but it did not work in py3 
   in curve_fit the check is for list, tuple or np.ndarray
    pfp_rpLT 185,      186
    pfp_rpLT.TRF       56

e) general error, in pfp_rpLT in line 196 np.nan, but "import numpy" and not "import numpy as np"
    np.nan     ==> numpy.nan

f) Source vs source, DependencyCheck and ApplyFcStorage are the only two which request a 'Source' in the 
   controlfile although the controlfilecheck will always set it back to 'source' when opening the file
